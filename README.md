# Module 4 Challenge

This is the README for the repository of the Module 4 Challenge of Joseph Rodante in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. This application is a timed quiz on JavaScript that will award points to the player based on how many questions they answered correctly and on how much time is remaining.
